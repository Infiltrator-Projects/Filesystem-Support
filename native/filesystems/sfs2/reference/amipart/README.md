# AmiPart

A native AmigaOS 2.x hard disk partition editor with full RDB (Rigid Disk Block) support.

> **Note:** AmiPart is the software formerly known as **DiskPart** — renamed to avoid confusion with the unrelated Microsoft Windows tool of the same name. Same program, same author, new name.

## Download

**[Latest build](https://github.com/ChuckyGang/AmiPart/releases/latest)** — including the executable, an autoboot ADF, and a native Linux CLI binary. Click **Assets** on that page to see the downloadable files.

## Linux CLI

AmiPart also builds as a **native Linux command-line tool** from the same
source — the full CLI and script engine, operating on disk image files
(`.hdf`), with backups made on the Amiga verifiable on Linux and vice
versa:

```
make linux                          # builds host/amipart (plain gcc, no deps)
./host/amipart IMAGE=disk.hdf INFO
./host/amipart SCRIPT prep.script FORCE
./host/amipart ?
```

Same commands and syntax as the Amiga version (see `cmdline.txt`).
Raw devices work too — `sudo ./host/amipart DEV=/dev/sdb INFO` — with
the disk opened exclusively (mounted disks are refused by the kernel).
Quick-format works here too: AmiPart's internal formatter writes FFS/OFS,
PFS3 and SFS volumes itself, byte-identical to the real handlers.
See `host/README.txt` for details.

## About

AmiPart is a partition management tool for the Amiga, built as a clean GadTools application that runs directly on Kickstart 2.x with no external library dependencies beyond the ROM. It was created out of a simple conviction: the Amiga deserves a good, modern partition editor — and it is better to have one now than never.

> *"Vibecoded software might be argued with, but this is an experiment in what AI-assisted development can produce when given a clear goal and a demanding user."*

## Requirements

- AmigaOS 2.x (Kickstart 2.04 or later)
- Intuition, GadTools, DOS libraries (all standard ROM)
- ASL library optional (enables the Browse file requester in the filesystem driver dialog)

---

## Usage

Run `AmiPart` from the Shell or double-click from Workbench.

1. A device selector appears listing all detected disk controllers.
   Use **Filter / Show All** to toggle between storage-only and full device lists.
2. Select a device and click **Select** — a progress window shows each unit being probed.
3. Select a unit and click **Select** to open the partition editor.
4. Use the buttons along the bottom to manage partitions and filesystem drivers.
5. Click **Write** when satisfied to commit changes to disk.

### Workbench icon tooltypes

When launched by double-clicking its icon, AmiPart reads these tooltypes from the icon (set them via the icon's **Information** window, or `NOWARNING` on the CLI):

- `NOWARNING` — suppresses the startup disclaimer.
- `WINDOW=left/top/width/height` — restores the partition editor window to this position and size on open, e.g. `WINDOW=50/30/640/400`. Ignored (falls back to the default centered size) if the saved geometry no longer fits the current screen — for example after switching to a smaller resolution. Not read when AmiPart is run from the Shell.

## Building

Supports two m68k toolchains, auto-detected by `make`:

- **Bebbo** (`m68k-amigaos-gcc`, default `/opt/amiga`)
- **Bartman/Abyss** (`m68k-amiga-elf-gcc`)

```sh
make                       # auto-detect (prefers Bartman when its VS Code extension is installed, else Bebbo)
make TOOLCHAIN=bebbo       # force Bebbo
make TOOLCHAIN=bartman     # force Bartman
```

Or build with the Bebbo toolchain via Docker (no host install required):

```sh
./docker.sh
```

`make adf` builds `out/AmiPart.adf`, an autoboot floppy image that boots
straight into AmiPart (no Workbench needed). Requires amitools
(`pip install amitools`) for its xdftool.

Output: `out/AmiPart`

## A Note on Vibecoding

This project was developed through AI-assisted ("vibecoded") collaboration — the architecture, decisions, and direction came from a human; the implementation was written by an AI. Whether that makes the software more or less trustworthy is a fair question. The answer offered here is: judge it by what it does, read the source if you want, and always keep a backup before touching partition tables.
